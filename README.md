# 👏 Emphasize 👏
Amongst the people I follow on Twitter, this 👏 has 👏 become 👏 a 👏 way 👏 of 👏 emphasizing 👏 one's 👏 point. 

I think it's hilarious. But when I tried writing like that, copy-pasting the 👏 emoji quickly got annoying. So I made this: http://shivankaul.com/emphasize

Just type in a normal sentence, and press Enter.

Now if I could just make a similar tool for **empathy**, the internets would be bearable.
